The winter camp season has come to an end, and spring is arriving.

The first outdoor rides at home are already getting closer. It has been the first winter where I have had the chance to go twice on a three-week camp. Monte Gordo after Christmas was a blast, and lots of base miles were collected under the Portuguese sun. Then I spent two weeks at home before hopping on another plane to Fuerteventura with Swiss Triathlon. It all started well, but I got sick after some days and eventually had to take it a bit easier for a couple of days before I was back to full power again for the second half of the camp. Sometimes this happens and cannot be entirely controlled. Yet, Iâ€™m glad I could end the camp with lots of learning and increased fitness. The upcoming five weeks are all set to prepare for the first upcoming European Cup in Quarteira.
