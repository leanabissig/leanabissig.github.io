The third Bundesliga race of the season was quite a spectacular course. This time it was in the south of Germany, near Munich/Chiemsee. The swim and run courses were quite normal, but on the bike we had to do a 3.8km climb at the end. In addition, the second transition area was on top of the hill, meaning there was no descent.

My swim was really good for one of the first times, and I exited the water just a few seconds behind the leaders. I quickly found myself in the lead group on the bike. For the first 10 kilometers, we moved slowly until we reached the bottom of the climb. But then it was all out attack. I could initially keep up with the best, but I eventually had to let them go. Despite this, I managed to get the 11th best cycling split entering transition in 11th place. I struggled a little on the run, but I only dropped one spot and finished 12th, my best Bundesliga result to date. Even more exciting was our team placing fourth, which we had never done before. Another great and successful weekend with the team.
