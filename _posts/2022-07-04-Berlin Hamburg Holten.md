The Bundesliga race in Berlin had been on my mind for quite a while, and I was super excited once I knew I could support the team. The swim was in the Wannsee lake. Then we cycled through the forest of Gruenewald all the way up to the Olympic stadium. And the run course took us along the stadium. My swim didn't go very well, which left me in the middle of the field and I never found my way back into the race. 

Therefore, it was even better to spend some time in Hamburg with friends, walking their dog and exploring the city afterwards. For the first time, I also had my road bike with me so I could cycle a beautiful loop along the Elbe and through the countryside. 

Time flew by quickly and on Thursday I took the train to Deventer (Netherlands) for one of the most famous European Cups on the circuit, EC Holten. The race went quite well, even though the swim part was still not where I wanted it to be. However, we worked well together on the bike and caught the group in front of us. The run went very well and I was able to finish in 21st position out of 59 competitors. It will definitely be a race I want to come back to in the upcoming years. The evening after the race, Artur and I enjoyed the beautiful Dutch city of Deventer, where we stayed. The same weekend there was a street festival in this city, so quite a lot was going on with music, food, people and artists. We had a great time there; a beautiful sunset; and will hopefully be back someday. 

On Sunday, the day after the race, we took the train down to DÃ¼sseldorf, where we visited my best friend from my exchange year in Canada. We did some sightseeing and just enjoyed the time together before we headed back to Switzerland and my 2-week Germany trip came to an end.
