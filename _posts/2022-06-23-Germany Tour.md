10 days, 2 races, 4 cities and testing the Deutsche Bahn train network over the entire country. After the confirmation of my start at the Bundesliga Finals in Berlin (German Championships), I had some logistic issues reducing the amount of travelling. Luckily, the idea of visiting friends in Hamburg and spending the weekdays there came up to my mind quickly. From there, I will then travel further to the Netherlands for the European Cup in Holten, a race I am really excited about. Lastly, as travelling by train is such a nice thing ;), I thought why not make a last stoppover in DÃ¼sseldorf to visit another good friend. Quite excited for this trip and lets see how it goes (and how many train connections I'll miss):).
