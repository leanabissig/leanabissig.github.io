10 days, 2 races, 4 cities, and testing of the Deutsche Bahn train network over the entire country. After the confirmation of my start at the Bundesliga Finals in Berlin (German Championships), I had some logistic issues in order to reduce the amount of travel. Luckily, the idea of visiting friends in Hamburg and spending the weekdays there came to my mind. I will then travel from Hamburg to the Netherlands for the European Cup in Holten, a race I am really excited about. Finally, because traveling by train is such a pleasant experience;), I decided to make a final stopover in DÃ¼sseldorf to see another good friend. I'm quite excited for this trip and let's see how it goes (and how many train connections I'll miss) :).
