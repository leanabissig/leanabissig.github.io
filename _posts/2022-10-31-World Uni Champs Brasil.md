It was that time of year again to visit the mountains, escaping the 35 degree Celsius heat. The excitement for all the good training sessions, riding the alpine passes and enjoying the beautiful landscape was real. Sadly, starting from day 3, I had some stomach issues, which started a whole up and down for one week until I was finally taken out completely by tonsillitis. We decided to end the camp one week earlier and head home to get some good rest and to best prepare for two very exciting races coming up. 

I'll be making my world cup debut at WC Bergen at the end of August. It sounds a bit scary, but I'm also really looking forward to it. In addition, I was nominated to compete in the FISU World University Championship in Brazil two weeks after Bergen. It will definitely be quite an adventure. The race will be over the sprint distance, followed by a mixed team relay the day after.
